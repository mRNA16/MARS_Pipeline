## MARS_Pipeline
### Introduction
The project is based on [official MARS](https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS) developed byPete Sanderson and Ken Vollmar.
Compared with the original MARS,this project extends it to support simple five-stage pipeline mode.The instructions supported 
include`add,sub,sll,jr,ori,lui,beq,lw,sw,j,jal`.If you want extra ones,you can add them in `mars/simulator/PipelineSimulator.java`.    

This repo is created to serve the Computer Organization and Architecture course of BUAA,for educational purposes only,without any commercial use.
We respect all copyrights of the original authors.    

Also,we do not allow this project to be used for any commercial activities of a profit-making nature other than learning and teaching purposes without
permission.      

The development is firstly conducted by Tian Xiangyu,member of the BUAA CO STAR group.Hoping my work could help you have a tremendous and unforgettable experience during CO!
